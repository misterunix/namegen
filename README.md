# namegen

The start of a name generator. 

The code is very messy but working so far:

Generate first name (female and male) based on just a random selection or based on the percentage frequency of the name.

Last name both random and frequency based work.

When generating a new DB the 152000+ surnames in the frequency list can be limited to any vale from all to, whatever is needed.   
The generic list of lastnames as 15000+ names.  

All text files are located in storage.
The database _sqlite_ is in the direcory db/ from the root of where the program is run from.

A count of generated names can be set as well.

Use the -h to see the current list of options.

Added README.md to all directories so they will store in git.
